Office 2021 Professional Purchase,"I have purchased Microsoft Office software from other vendors before and have had a time getting the activation key to work if at all.

The whole experience started out…,"The whole experience started out different.  My old Office was a dinosaur and struggled to be loaded, and when it finally did, I think a turtle would have won any race.  So, I was glad to see the Office 2019 with a price that I was OK with and it included just the 4 apps that I use the most.Getting the new product downloaded was a challenge.  It took several times to finally get things right.  After installing it, I was told that the product had been registered already and the product key that was sent to me would not work.  Ugh!I sent a text for help, and it was replied to within a very short few hour.  After doing what the reply text response suggested.  It still didn't work.  Same error message.  Finally, I called and did as was suggested that was to use my phone to get the product installed correctly.   And it worked!  Yea!I can say now that I am very happy with the product.  It is what I had originally expected.  The people that I worked with were patient and spoke encouragingly.Now - I can say that I am very grateful for the product and staff.Thanks - Dave",Dave,"February 05, 2025",5

Windows 11 Pro license Doesn't Work,"I purchased a Windows 11 Pro license. When I tried to activate it, Microsoft said it was already activated on another system. I reached out to customer service and they said to try to activate by phone. The phone number I called was busy for over an hour and I couldn't get through. I requested a refund and they said they have to confirm with Microsoft that the license has not been activated before they would issue a refund. That's LITERLLY why I contacted them. They sold me a code that was already activated. Be very cautious of using this company to buy suspicious Microsoft licenses.",Clint G,"January 19, 2025",1

Kat was very patient walking me through the install steps and reproducing the error. She took the extra effort and looked over several files and installed programs on my machine. Then she quickly researched if there were issues regarding installing Visio Pro 2016 with MS Office Pro 2016 already installed. She determined that they use different installers and cannot coexist.,Gaylord Hanson,"September 24, 2024",5

Issues transferring Office license,I purchased an Office 2019 Home & Student from Mychoicesoftware back in 2021 and activated/used it with no issues on my laptop.  I recently switched laptops.  Office was removed from the old laptop and installed on the new laptop following Mychoicesoftware's instructions but I ran into issues activating it on the new device (Microsoft product key is not valid error).  Mychoicesoftware Support was prompt and offered several reasons ranging from the key being OEM (non transferrable) to mainstream support for Office 2019 ending in 2023.  I contacted Microsoft support who asked me to securely upload the CD key to them and then remoted into my new laptop to attempt the activation.  Microsoft confirmed the CD key was not valid and asked that I work with the reseller to have a new one issued or purchase a new one.  I relayed that information to Mychoicesoftware who advised me that they couldn't assist any further.  I ended up purchasing an Office 2024 license as updates for 2019 will be ending later this year.  Just a precaution for prospective customers: check with Mychoicesoftware to make sure the license you're purchasing is transferrable to another device as the website doesn't make that clear when I reviewed the 3 Office 2019 choices.  PCs like everything else have the risk of failing.,Shawn,"January 16, 2025",2

I was told no because they can't re-sell it, yet they said I could somehow resell it on Ebay, with makes no sense to me. I would not recommend this company as they are  not at all straightforward about return policies and clearly do not are about their customers after they have their money! They say most products can be returned in 30 days, but make it very difficult to understand which ones. I am sure they have covered themselves legally with fine print.

The  best Support in the world.,"Hello., to whom it may concern.I used to a while back, keep. a virtual machine loaded at all times. And every time it would crash, I would have to call  and pay $200 to give me a new key just for my virtual machine. After I'd paid. well over $1000. I decided to look elsewhere for my keys. That's when I found My Choice Software. And they were selling keys.. For upgrade. and they were quite a bit cheaper than $200. So I figured, well, I'll take a chance and buy one of their keys and see how it goes. And I did that. and I took the key they sold me. and I entered into this virtual machine, and it accepted it. And then when I was done with the virtual machine, the virtual machine was activated. because I was using a. workstation. 17 to to build this virtual machine. And that's just the way it works. At that time, I didn't have to call because it worked. It just worked. I almost fell over. The next time I went for a key. I remembered that My Choice seemed to work well. And I bought another key from them.. This time I had a problem. and it has been so long ago that I don't remember exactly what the problem was. So I went and got their email for the support. And I sent them a description of the problem I was having which at this time I don't remember cause it was a few years ago. And I sent them email, and I figured, well, it'll probably be at least. a week before they get back to me. Um, that's how it works with everybody, all companies. When you try to get support from them, they never get back to you like within a day or two. But guess what? I had an email come back to me. No more than 20 minutes after I sent them the email. And the email they sent me. had a solution to my problem. And I said I didn't even talk to them to tell them what my problem was. And I know I don't describe things well, but they had a solution to my problem when I tried it. And it worked. these people are amazing. I have since then, got several keys from them. One of the things that is Afghanistan. for different things. And they've all worked and.. The last key I bought from them was the key to upgrade Windows 11 home to pro and they sent me back. the keys. Which, by the way? we're a lot cheaper than I could have got them 0...............................e...............l.0000000 And they had the regular instructions for upgrading to for using an upgrade key, which involved. using Microsoft's. operating system generator, whatever that I forget that they call it at this time, but anyhow it's the same one that that that used it. It creates an ISO and et cetera, et cetera. Anyhow I already had Windows 11 home installed and running and and I thought, well, why should I have to go to Microsoft and read down the operating system when I've already got it? and again I sent them an email. asking them if I couldn't just go right for the activation instead of downloading that thing from Microsoft They sent me back an email. I'm I'm not kidding. There was more than 15 or 20 minutes again with the instructions on how to bike how I could load the keys without redownloading the operating system from Microsoft. This company has my business forever. If I ever need a key, I certainly wouldn't go to anywhere else but The my choice software because just because of the support. Support is so important and they have the best support in the world. I can't believe the support that the way they support their product. And When you talk to their support people and you tell them your problem, you don't get any of this. Well, let me see. Can you, can you tell me this again? Can you do this? Can you try this? I don't think they ever say, can you try anything? They just say to do it. And they all seem to know the answer. So I don't know it's it's amazing. you know, this is going too long, isn't it? I'm a little bit chatty. That's just me. but I can't. I really cannot speak. highly enough of the support they offer when they're with their product. The person that helped me. His name was Gabe. and like everybody else, he was very knowledgeable about the fact I did try to. Sort of disagree with them, but he was telling me and he he just told me just to follow the instructions. I know this review is too long, I'm just too chatty. But  when I'm really up on something  I just can't say enough. You know, 5 stars is not enough. They need to have at least 20 or 30 stars. Or maybe more. They asked me some questions at the start. Of course, I've forgotten what they are. They asked me about my experience with this problem. Well, I've already said that it was excellent. It worked right away and. the person that I talked to was very knowledgeable. His name was Gabe again and I couldn't be more satisfied. I can't think of anything bad to say about him. There's no negatives.",George Jorgensen,"November 29, 2024",5

**CAUTION** Use caution when purchasing software from MyChoiceSoftware & pay attention to license!!!,"If I could give it a zero star I would. I purchased Microsoft Home and Business for my home computer from Mychoicesoftware.com. This worked on my computer, HOWEVER it is not at all clear on their product page that this is NOT a product that you can transfer, or reload. After having this installed on my computer, I uninstalled and went to reinstall on a new computer. After over 2 hrs on the phone with Microsoft, I was told that this was NOT a product for consumer sale (see screenshot), and used a developer license. After reaching out to Mychoicesoftware customer support, was told that this was clear on the product page and that because I loaded it one time they were good. So for a savings of $20 from the full Microsoft license, I don't have any ability to reload a product that was not intended for resale to begin with. Spend the extra little bit and buy direct from Microsoft so you can reload as needed and have for the true life of the product, not only a one time use. Disappointing customer service and even more disappointing they sold a product that shouldn't have been sold and did NOTHING about it.",David,"November 07, 2023",1

However, after our chat ended, I realized that I still needed assistance, so I then CALLED Microsoft, and it must've been my lucky day, because Finn actually answered the phone!I feel very fortunate to have come in contact with Finn in the first place, and to know that I can still turn to him and/or his teammates, for assistance with any Microsoft-related questions and concerns, going forward.Thanks again, Finn!

"YES, YOU CAN TRUST THEM","I made an impulse purchase of a 17-inch laptop at a Flea Market, and while it has worked fine (so far), I eventually got a watermark on my desktop that I wasn't using an authorized version of Windows. 'You gotta be kidding me' I thought. I called the Seller, and I was told to go back and see him at the Flea Market to get it taken care of. Well, that was 40 miles away, and I thought, what can he do. So I decided just to bite the bullet and do the right thing. I did a search on Google to buy it, and there were so many listings, but a number of them had many complaints about them, and I didn't want to take a chance and get ripped-off. So, I called Microsoft. I found out that they no longer sell their own product, because Windows 10 is so old and they no longer support it. They suggested Staples, Best Buy, and My Choice Software. Staples and Best Buy did not have any online, so I took a chance with My Choice. Navigating the site was easy, I made the purchase, and was able to download the software very quickly and got my Product Key. Now I'm legal and I don't have to worry about MS coming to my house to confiscate my laptop. I'm exaggerating, of course. But I am still a bit upset with the Seller, because the deal I got, turned out to be not that good. I learned a valuable lesson.

You might ask where does the warranty say that it will be voided by creating a 365 account with Microsoft, or simply that the warranty that will automatically terminate before you have a product?

False Advertising and Fraud,"This site advertises rewards points on every purchase. But, this is a lie and fraudulent. First of all you don't get rewards on ""every"" purchase, you only get rewards on select purchases. Even worse, you can't actually use the points you get for future purchases. I have had to call in no less than 8 times to try and get my points used. They conveniently hide the button that lets you use points for your purchase. I have tried multiple browsers, incognito, deleted cookies and history, none of their suggestions worked.

Spend the extra $ and go right to the source,"Purchase was relatively simple, though the email with the activation code for Windows 10 didn't come through for about 12 hours. I followed instructions for installing Windows 10 from a USB thumb drive, and it installed as advertised--but then the activation key didn't work. Microsoft's solutions are a maze of recursion and self-contradiction, and nothing from Mychoicesoftware helped to clear up the confusion. I needed to get Windows up and running swiftly, and I'm coming up on 24 hours into what should have been a simple installation and activation. I know Microsoft is a nightmare, but I'm wishing now that I'd just bought the (admittedly more expensive) option from the Microsoft Store.Followup: Mychoicesoftware gave me instructions as to how to get in touch with Microsoft. Microsoft Support walked me through the verification process and informed me that the software activations had been ""exhausted"" and that they couldn't help me. I've gone back to Mychoicesoftware to see what their solution is but given the time and energy I've invested to get this to work, I am definitely paying for having cheaped out.

BEWARE,"I purchased Microsoft Office Home & Business 2019 from this site on January 13th 2022.  I've seen this site before but just didn't trust the low pricing.  I should have listened to my instincts.  I went ahead and downloaded the image from the link they sent me.  When trying to install it on a brand new Dell Precision Windows 10 Professional PC, I got an error message telling me the installation was for a 32bit operating system.  That angered me immediately - Luckily Dell had the 64bit installation already preloaded (which I did not know) so it asked if I wanted to install the 64bit, which of course I said yes.  After installing it asked for the license key.  I pasted the license key they sent me in email - and low and behold - the key had already been used the maximum number of times.  How unsurprising.  I will never buy from this scam site again.  I called Microsoft and thankfully they helped me get a legitimate key to activate the software.",Sean,"January 15, 2022",1
MyChoiceSoftware is selling USED/PreActivated products,"I have purchased SEVERAL dozen Office 2019 product codes from MyChoice over the last few years.   I have noticed that the codes that I have been purchasing are not following the procedures that Microsoft states must be used to ""activate"" those codes.  I have tried to activate several product codes that can not be activated and EVERY code I have received from MyChoice I have had to use the Telephone activation to activate the product.  According to Microsoft agents this is NOT normal and is a sure sign of Fraud.   Today (January 2022) I had a PC that I had purchased Office 2019 for in September 2019. It had run an MS update that corrupted the Office install.  I eventually had to completely uninstall office na dtry to reinstall office.  It would not activate. I tried several methods to activate it and each time it failed.  I contacted MS support adn they told me the product had been activated at least 30 times by 20 different Hardware IDs and it was first activated PRIOR to the date I purchased the product key from MyChoice.  MyChoice maintains that they do not sell used products  but cannot explain explain how my product keys were activated PRIOR to me purchasing them from MyChoice.  They refuse to replace the product key and say that Microsoft's system are in error.   Given all the problems I've had with Activated dozens of Product ID's from Mychoice, it now makes sense what they've been doing.  I spent over 3 hours on the chat with Microsoft discussing all of this and over 1.5 hours on the chat with MyChoice.  I have both transcripts and have filed a fraud case with Microsoft against MyChoice and am contacting my attorney's to begin legal proceedings against MyChoice.

Approximately 12 hours after my purchase I contacted My Choice and was informed they had sold out of codes and that they might have some available Friday, 4 days after my purchase date.  Their site did not indicate the item was backordered.  I cancelled my order and purchased from Best Buy, who ended up Price Matching my order AND the code arrived immediately to my inbox.

Pray you never have to reinstall!,"I bought 3 copies of Microsoft Project. The product number listed by MyChoiceSoftware is Microsoft Product Number Z9V-00347 (which is NOT OEM software). Initially activated without issue. I have since needed to perform a reinstall and the product keys will not activate. Microsoft states that the product key “has been blocked” and implies that this is because “the product key was stolen or otherwise fraudulently obtained” MyChoiceSoftware customer service says that the product ""was not meant to be reinstalled"" which is contrary to Microsoft's published licensing agreements (even on OEM Software). You may reinstall on the same device as many times as necessary. MyChoiceSoftware also states that this was OEM software, even though they did not advertise it as such and the listed Product number was not for an OEM version. (Even if it were, reinstallation is allowed and not prohibited by Microsoft) I purchased this product as a permanent license in good faith. It was not advertised as a ""one time use"" key (which would be highly unusual). Re-installation is a common event and is within the rights on all Microsoft Licenses. Microsoft does not lock keys without a reason and they imply that these keys were blocked because they were stolen or fraudulent.  MyChoiceSoftware has my money and they refuse to do anything. Buyer Beware!",Chris,"October 28, 2020",1

So far I am very disappointed with…,"So far I am very disappointed with Mychoicesoftware.  I ordered MS Office Home and Student this morning and waited 2 hours for my email with download instructions and license key, which should have arrived within 30 minutes according to their website.  (My credit card was charged immediately.) I called the customer support and spoke to someone that explained they were out of stock of that version.  I asked about an upgrade to next level of product, since their website states: ""Due to product availability, you may be upgraded"".  This appears to not be an option either.

Buyer Beware of MyChoiceSoftware!,"MyChoiceSoftware is still a scam.  They refuse to refund my money with the reason that I had downloaded the product code. How would I have known that I rec'd an OEM license vs. a Retail License until I downloaded it? The company did not inform me that I was purchasing an OEM license. They did not disclose that information until AFTER the product code was downloaded and there was an issue. It was like pulling teeth to finally get that information out of the company.  This issue will not be resolved until I am refunded my money.Purchased Office 2019 from MyChoiceSoftware & was assured it was a legit license that could be registered w/MS. Not only had the Product Key already been downloaded, it was an OEM license that could not be registered w/MS & not compatible with the 2nd MS product I wanted to purchase from them. So, it was useless. They refuse to refund my money.  I have reported them to BBB & MS.",Marianne W.,"September 12, 2020",1
